## Context & Goals

A regional bank approached us to develop a modern mobile banking application to compete with digital-first banks and improve customer engagement. Their existing mobile app was outdated, slow, and lacking essential features that customers expected.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Provide a secure, user-friendly mobile banking experience
- Implement modern security features including biometric authentication
- Enable real-time transaction processing and notifications
- Ensure compliance with financial regulations (PCI DSS, SOX)
- Achieve 99.9% uptime and handle high transaction volumes

## Security-First Architecture

Given the sensitive nature of financial data, security was the top priority throughout the entire development process.

### Security Measures Implemented

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID)
   - SMS and email verification
   - Hardware security module integration

2. **Data Encryption**
   - End-to-end encryption for all transactions
   - AES-256 encryption for data at rest
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Real-time transaction monitoring
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Geolocation verification

4. **Compliance**
   - PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
   - SOX compliance for financial reporting
   - GDPR compliance for data privacy

## User Experience Design

### Design Challenges

Banking apps face unique UX challenges:
- Balancing security with usability
- Managing complex financial information
- Building trust through design
- Accommodating users of all technical levels

### Our Approach

1. **User Research**: Conducted extensive interviews with existing customers to understand their pain points and needs
2. **Accessibility**: Ensured the app was accessible to users with disabilities
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Organized complex information hierarchically
4. **Trust Indicators**: Used visual cues to reinforce security and reliability

### Key Features

- **Dashboard**: Clean, intuitive overview of accounts and recent transactions
- **Quick Actions**: One-tap access to frequently used features
- **Transaction History**: Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **Bill Pay**: Streamlined bill payment with payee management
- **Money Transfer**: Instant transfers between accounts and to other users
- **Investment Tracking**: Real-time portfolio monitoring and trading

## Technical Implementation

### Cross-Platform Development

Chose React Native for its ability to deliver native performance while maintaining a single codebase for iOS and Android.

```typescript
// Example of secure authentication flow
const useSecureAuth = () => {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [authMethod, setAuthMethod] = useState<'biometric' | 'pin' | null>(null);

  const authenticateWithBiometrics = async () => {
    try {
      const biometricType = await TouchID.isSupported();
      if (biometricType) {
        const result = await TouchID.authenticate('Authenticate to access your account');
        if (result) {
          await validateSession();
          setIsAuthenticated(true);
          setAuthMethod('biometric');
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Biometric authentication failed:', error);
      fallbackToPinAuth();
    }
  };

  const validateSession = async () => {
    // Validate session with backend
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/validate', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${await getSecureToken()}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Session validation failed');
    }
  };

  return { isAuthenticated, authMethod, authenticateWithBiometrics };
};
```

### Real-Time Features

Implemented WebSocket connections for real-time updates:
- Transaction notifications
- Account balance updates
- Security alerts
- System maintenance notifications

### Performance Optimization
